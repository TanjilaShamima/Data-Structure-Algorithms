// Space Complexity
// Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs.
// It is a function of the size of the input to the algorithm.
// Space complexity is usually expressed in big O notation.

// Space complexity is the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run to completion.
// It is usually expressed in terms of the size of the input to the algorithm.
// Space complexity is usually expressed in big O notation.
// Space complexity is usually expressed in terms of the size of the input to the algorithm.
